        <ol class="num-counter">
            <li>
                The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a worldwide organization for standardization
                comprising all national electrotechnical committees (IEC National Committees). The object of IEC is to
                promote international co-operation on all questions concerning standardization in the electrical and
                electronic fields. To this end and in addition to other activities, IEC publishes International
                Standards, Technical Specifications, Technical Reports, Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) and
                Guides (hereafter referred to as “IEC Publication(s)”). Their preparation is entrusted to technical
                committees; any IEC National Committee interested in the subject dealt with may participate in this
                preparatory work. International, governmental and non-governmental organizations liaising with the IEC
                also participate in this preparation. IEC collaborates closely with the International Organization for
                Standardization (ISO) in accordance with conditions determined by agreement between the two
                organizations.
            </li>

            <li>
                The formal decisions or agreements of IEC on technical matters express, as nearly as possible, an
                international consensus of opinion on the relevant subjects since each technical committee has
                representation from all interested IEC National Committees.
            </li>

            <li>
                IEC Publications have the form of recommendations for international use and are accepted by IEC National
                Committees in that sense. While all reasonable efforts are made to ensure that the technical content of
                IEC Publications is accurate, IEC cannot be held responsible for the way in which they are used or for
                any misinterpretation by any end user.
            </li>

            <li>
                In order to promote international uniformity, IEC National Committees undertake to apply IEC
                Publications transparently to the maximum extent possible in their national and regional publications.
                Any divergence between any IEC Publication and the corresponding national or regional publication shall
                be clearly indicated in the latter.
            </li>

            <li>
                IEC itself does not provide any attestation of conformity. Independent certification bodies provide
                conformity assessment services and, in some areas, access to IEC marks of conformity. IEC is not
                responsible for any services carried out by independent certification bodies.
            </li>

            <li>
                All users should ensure that they have the latest edition of this publication.
            </li>

            <li>
                No liability shall attach to IEC or its directors, employees, servants or agents including individual
                experts and members of its technical committees and IEC National Committees for any personal injury,
                property damage or other damage of any nature whatsoever, whether direct or indirect, or for costs
                (including legal fees) and expenses arising out of the publication, use of, or reliance upon, this IEC
                Publication or any other IEC Publications.
            </li>

            <li>
                Attention is drawn to the Normative references cited in this publication. Use of the referenced
                publications is indispensable for the correct application of this publication.
            </li>

            <li>
                Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this IEC Publication may be the
                subject of patent rights. IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent
                rights.

            <p class="text-center">INTRODUCTION</p>

            <p>This document has been prepared to provide, based on IEC 60601-1:2005 (third edition) and
                its collaterals, a complete set of safety requirements for ME EQUIPMENT for RADIOGRAPHY and
                RADIOSCOPY. The purpose of this second edition is to introduce changes to reference the second
                amendment (2020) to IEC 60601-1:2005 and associated collateral standards. Moreover, in
                Annex AA a clarification of the term for ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE is provided. This document
                addresses the system level of X-RAY EQUIPMENT, which consists of a combination of an X-RAY
                GENERATOR, ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT and ACCESSORIES. Component functions are addressed as
                far as necessary.
            </p>

            <p>The minimum safety requirements specified in this document are considered to provide for a
                practical degree of safety in the operation of ME EQUIPMENT for RADIOGRAPHY and RADIOSCOPY.
                Requirements for additional provisions for ME EQUIPMENT for interventional applications are
                covered by IEC 60601-2-43.

            <small>Note 1 to entry: Usually, the X-RAY BEAM AXIS coincides within required tolerances with the REFERENCE
                AXIS of the
                RADIATION SOURCE.
