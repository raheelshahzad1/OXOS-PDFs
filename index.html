                The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a worldwide organization for standardization
                comprising all national electrotechnical committees (IEC National Committees). The object of IEC is to
                promote international co-operation on all questions concerning standardization in the electrical and
                electronic fields. To this end and in addition to other activities, IEC publishes International
                Standards, Technical Specifications, Technical Reports, Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) and
                Guides (hereafter referred to as “IEC Publication(s)”). Their preparation is entrusted to technical
                committees; any IEC National Committee interested in the subject dealt with may participate in this
                preparatory work. International, governmental and non-governmental organizations liaising with the IEC
                also participate in this preparation. IEC collaborates closely with the International Organization for
                Standardization (ISO) in accordance with conditions determined by agreement between the two
                organizations.

            This document has been prepared to provide, based on IEC 60601-1:2005 (third edition) and
            its collaterals, a complete set of safety requirements for ME EQUIPMENT for RADIOGRAPHY and
            RADIOSCOPY. The purpose of this second edition is to introduce changes to reference the second
            amendment (2020) to IEC 60601-1:2005 and associated collateral standards. Moreover, in
            Annex AA a clarification of the term for ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE is provided. This document addresses the
            system level of X-RAY EQUIPMENT, which consists of
            a combination of an X-RAY GENERATOR, ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT and ACCESSORIES. Component
            functions are addressed as far as necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
            The minimum safety requirements specified in this document are considered to provide for a
            practical degree of safety in the operation of ME EQUIPMENT for RADIOGRAPHY and RADIOSCOPY.
            Requirements for additional provisions for ME EQUIPMENT for interventional applications are
            covered by IEC 60601-2-43.

            </p>

            <p>
                A requirement of a particular standard takes priority over IEC 60601-1:2005,

            <p>Addition:</p>

            <p>
                The internal impedance of a SUPPLY MAINS is to shall be considered sufficiently low for the
                operation of X-RAY EQUIPMENT for RADIOGRAPHY and RADIOSCOPY if the value of the APPARENT
                RESISTANCE OF SUPPLY MAINS does not exceed the value specified in the ACCOMPANYING
                DOCUMENTS.
            </p>

            <p>
                Either the APPARENT RESISTANCE OF SUPPLY MAINS or other appropriate SUPPLY MAINS specifications used in
                a
                facility shall be specified in the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS.
            </p>

            <p>
                NOTE If a NOMINAL voltage is claimed for a mains power supply system, it is assumed that there is no
                voltage
                of a higher value between any of the conductors of the system or between any of these conductors and
                earth.
            </p>

            <p>
                An alternating voltage is considered in practice to be sinusoidal if any instantaneous value of the
                waveform
                concerned differs from the instantaneous value of the ideal waveform at the same moment by no more than
                ± 2
                % of the peak value of the ideal waveform.
            </p>

            <p>
                A three-phase SUPPLY MAINS is considered to have a practical symmetry if it delivers symmetrical
                voltages
                and produces, when loaded symmetrically, symmetrical currents.
            </p>

            <p>
                The requirements of this document are based upon the assumption that three-phase systems have a
                symmetrical
                configuration of the MAINS VOLTAGE with respect to earth. Single-phase systems may can be derived from
                such
                three-phase systems. Where the supply system is not earthed at the source it is assumed that adequate
                measures have been provided to detect, limit and remedy any disturbance of symmetry within a reasonably
                short time.
            </p>

            <p>
                X-RAY EQUIPMENT is considered to comply with the requirements of this document only if its specified
                NOMINAL
                ELECTRIC POWER can be demonstrated at an APPARENT RESISTANCE OF SUPPLY MAINS having a value not less
                than
                the APPARENT RESISTANCE OF SUPPLY MAINS specified by the MANUFACTURER in the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS.

            <p>
                The high-voltage circuit of the ME EQUIPMENT is tested by applying no more than half the
                test voltage, and then the test voltage is gradually raised over a period of 10 s to the full value,
                which is maintained for 3 min in RADIOGRAPHY and 15 min in RADIOSCOPY.
            </p>

            <p>Addition to the test conditions for high-voltage circuit:</p>
            <p>
                The test for the high-voltage circuit shall be made without an X-RAY TUBE ASSEMBLY connected
                and with a test voltage of 1,2 times the NOMINAL X-RAY TUBE VOLTAGE of the ME EQUIPMENT.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the ME EQUIPMENT can be tested only with the X-RAY TUBE ASSEMBLY connected and if the
                X-RAY TUBE does not allow the ME EQUIPMENT to be tested with a test voltage of 1,2 times the NOMINAL X-
                RAY TUBE VOLTAGE, the test voltage may be lower but not less than 1,1 times that voltage.
            </p>
            <p>
                For ME EQUIPMENT in which the NOMINAL X-RAY TUBE VOLTAGE for RADIOSCOPY does not exceed 80 %
                of that for RADIOGRAPHY, the test voltage for the high-voltage circuit shall be referred to the value
                for RADIOGRAPHY, and the test shall be carried out in that mode only.
            </p>
            <p>
                If during the dielectric strength test there is a RISK of overheating a transformer under
                test, it is permitted to carry out the test at a higher supply frequency.

                                removable RADIOGRAPHIC CASSETTE holder. An appropriate warning shall be included in the
                                INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE.</p>
                            <p><sup>c</sup> The PRIMARY PROTECTIVE SHIELDING shall extend beyond the largest IMAGE
                                RECEPTION AREA by at least 2 % of the FOCAL SPOT to IMAGE RECEPTOR DISTANCE.</p>
                            <p><sup>d</sup> The applicable voltage shall be the NOMINAL X-RAY TUBE VOLTAGE for
                                RADIOSCOPY or, if a SPOTFILM DEVICE is provided, 66 % of the NOMINAL X-RAY TUBE VOLTAGE
                                for RADIOGRAPHY, whichever is higher.</p>
                            <p><sup>e</sup> The reference X-RAY TUBE CURRENT shall be 3 mA or the value corresponding to
                                the maximum CONTINUOUS ANODE INPUT POWER, whichever is less.</p>
                            <p><sup>f</sup> The reference LOADING FACTORS shall be those corresponding to the MAXIMUM
                                ENERGY input in a single LOADING according to the RADIOGRAPHIC RATINGS.</p>
                            <p><sup>g</sup> The periphery of the required extent of the PRIMARY PROTECTIVE SHIELDING
                                shall correspond to the shape of the RADIATION APERTURE, unless the needed PRIMARY
                                PROTECTIVE SHIELDING can be reached otherwise.</p>
