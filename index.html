                The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a worldwide organization for standardization
                comprising all national electrotechnical committees (IEC National Committees). The object of IEC is to
                promote international co-operation on all questions concerning standardization in the electrical and
                electronic fields. To this end and in addition to other activities, IEC publishes International
                Standards, Technical Specifications, Technical Reports, Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) and
                Guides (hereafter referred to as “IEC Publication(s)”). Their preparation is entrusted to technical
                committees; any IEC National Committee interested in the subject dealt with may participate in this
                preparatory work. International, governmental and non-governmental organizations liaising with the IEC
                also participate in this preparation. IEC collaborates closely with the International Organization for
                Standardization (ISO) in accordance with conditions determined by agreement between the two
                organizations.

            This document has been prepared to provide, based on IEC 60601-1:2005 (third edition) and
            its collaterals, a complete set of safety requirements for ME EQUIPMENT for RADIOGRAPHY and
            RADIOSCOPY. The purpose of this second edition is to introduce changes to reference the second
            amendment (2020) to IEC 60601-1:2005 and associated collateral standards. Moreover, in
            Annex AA a clarification of the term for ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE is provided. This document addresses the
            system level of X-RAY EQUIPMENT, which consists of
            a combination of an X-RAY GENERATOR, ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT and ACCESSORIES. Component
            functions are addressed as far as necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
            The minimum safety requirements specified in this document are considered to provide for a
            practical degree of safety in the operation of ME EQUIPMENT for RADIOGRAPHY and RADIOSCOPY.
            Requirements for additional provisions for ME EQUIPMENT for interventional applications are
            covered by IEC 60601-2-43.

            </p>

            <p>
                A requirement of a particular standard takes priority over IEC 60601-1:2005,

            <p>Addition:</p>

            <p>
                The internal impedance of a SUPPLY MAINS is to shall be considered sufficiently low for the
                operation of X-RAY EQUIPMENT for RADIOGRAPHY and RADIOSCOPY if the value of the APPARENT
                RESISTANCE OF SUPPLY MAINS does not exceed the value specified in the ACCOMPANYING
                DOCUMENTS.
            </p>

            <p>
                Either the APPARENT RESISTANCE OF SUPPLY MAINS or other appropriate SUPPLY MAINS specifications used in
                a
                facility shall be specified in the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS.
            </p>

            <p>
                NOTE If a NOMINAL voltage is claimed for a mains power supply system, it is assumed that there is no
                voltage
                of a higher value between any of the conductors of the system or between any of these conductors and
                earth.
            </p>

            <p>
                An alternating voltage is considered in practice to be sinusoidal if any instantaneous value of the
                waveform
                concerned differs from the instantaneous value of the ideal waveform at the same moment by no more than
                ± 2
                % of the peak value of the ideal waveform.
            </p>

            <p>
                A three-phase SUPPLY MAINS is considered to have a practical symmetry if it delivers symmetrical
                voltages
                and produces, when loaded symmetrically, symmetrical currents.
            </p>

            <p>
                The requirements of this document are based upon the assumption that three-phase systems have a
                symmetrical
                configuration of the MAINS VOLTAGE with respect to earth. Single-phase systems may can be derived from
                such
                three-phase systems. Where the supply system is not earthed at the source it is assumed that adequate
                measures have been provided to detect, limit and remedy any disturbance of symmetry within a reasonably
                short time.
            </p>

            <p>
                X-RAY EQUIPMENT is considered to comply with the requirements of this document only if its specified
                NOMINAL
                ELECTRIC POWER can be demonstrated at an APPARENT RESISTANCE OF SUPPLY MAINS having a value not less
                than
                the APPARENT RESISTANCE OF SUPPLY MAINS specified by the MANUFACTURER in the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS.

            <p>Amendment to the compliance test for high-voltage circuit:</p>
            <p>
                The high-voltage circuit of the ME EQUIPMENT is tested by applying no more than half the
                test voltage, and then the test voltage is gradually raised over a period of 10 s to the full value,
                which is maintained for 3 min in RADIOGRAPHY and 15 min in RADIOSCOPY.
            </p>

            <p>Addition to the test conditions for high-voltage circuit:</p>
            <p>
                The test for the high-voltage circuit shall be made without an X-RAY TUBE ASSEMBLY connected
                and with a test voltage of 1,2 times the NOMINAL X-RAY TUBE VOLTAGE of the ME EQUIPMENT.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the ME EQUIPMENT can be tested only with the X-RAY TUBE ASSEMBLY connected and if the
                X-RAY TUBE does not allow the ME EQUIPMENT to be tested with a test voltage of 1,2 times the NOMINAL X-
                RAY TUBE VOLTAGE, the test voltage may be lower but not less than 1,1 times that voltage.
            </p>
            <p>
                For ME EQUIPMENT in which the NOMINAL X-RAY TUBE VOLTAGE for RADIOSCOPY does not exceed 80 %
                of that for RADIOGRAPHY, the test voltage for the high-voltage circuit shall be referred to the value
                for RADIOGRAPHY, and the test shall be carried out in that mode only.
            </p>
            <p>
                If during the dielectric strength test there is a RISK of overheating a transformer under
                test, it is permitted to carry out the test at a higher supply frequency.

                Subclause 201.4.3.101 – Additional potential ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE requirements
            </p>
            <p>
                IEC 60601-1:2005, IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD:2020 state that
                the term ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE is directly related to the performance of a clinical function
                (definition 3.27 in IEC 60601-1:2005 and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012). Table 201.101 of this
                document provides a list of requirements that can be correlated with the performance of a
                clinical function and that can therefore be ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE. The decision on whether
                any of these requirements constitutes ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE is subject to a RISK EVALUATION
                that considers the INTENDED USE of the X-RAY EQUIPMENT.
            </p>
            <p>
                The identification of potential ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE requirements is justified because the RISK
                associated with ionizing X-RADIATION is overweighed by the benefits expected from the examination.
            </p>
            <p>
                The intent of the requirements in this document is to support MANUFACTURERS in providing
                state-of-the-art
                X-RAY EQUIPMENT that is safe under NORMAL CONDITIONS.

                detection of single faults during regular checks within a maintenance or a QUALITY CONTROL
                PROCEDURE is considered sufficient. In some other cases, a RISK which occurs under SINGLE

                SINGLE FAULT CONDITIONS that result in an unacceptable RISK due to the probability of harm or
                the SEVERITY of harm require additional RISK CONTROL measures. These RISK CONTROL measures
                are selected according to ISO 14971 and can include frequent functional self-monitoring,
                installation of redundant parts, or appropriate protective measures.

            </p>
            <p>
                This document allows the use of an indirect indication to estimate the ABSORBED DOSE to the
                skin. The estimate could be drawn from the indications of X-RAY EQUIPMENT parameters followed
                by a calculation of the primary AIR KERMA or AIR KERMA RATE at a point specified with reference
                to the FOCAL SPOT. The specified point, which has been defined here as the PATIENT ENTRANCE
                REFERENCE POINT, is intended to be representative of the point of intersection of the X-RAY BEAM
                AXIS with the PATIENT.
            </p>
            <p>
                For systems with an ISOCENTRE, a point on the REFERENCE AXIS 15 cm from the ISOCENTRE
                towards the FOCAL SPOT has been specified as the PATIENT ENTRANCE REFERENCE POINT. This
                distance is assumed to represent a good approximation of the value of the actual FOCAL SPOT
                TO SKIN DISTANCE during RADIOLOGICAL PROCEDURES. If one considers currently available
                methods to estimate ABSORBED DOSES to selected tissues for RADIOSCOPIC and cineangiographic
                examinations of the coronary arteries of adults [4], [5], these methods rely on the
                use of distinct operating conditions commonly used in RADIOLOGICAL examinations of the heart.
            </p>
            <p>
                These operating conditions are associated with a view, an arterial projection, and technique
                factors on the X-RAY EQUIPMENT such as the X-RAY TUBE VOLTAGE (kV), the HALF-VALUE LAYER
                (HVL), the FOCAL SPOT TO SKIN DISTANCE, the FOCAL SPOT TO IMAGE RECEPTOR DISTANCE and the
                ENTRANCE FIELD SIZE. A review of the operating conditions derived from analyses of practice [6],
                [9] indicates that the defined PATIENT ENTRANCE REFERENCE POINT is, in fact, a fair approximation
                of the FOCAL SPOT TO SKIN DISTANCE for each field.
            </p>
            <p>
                The error in estimating the ABSORBED DOSE to the skin introduced from the defined PATIENT
                ENTRANCE REFERENCE POINT should average out as long as the interventional PROCEDURE is
                composed of multiple views. When the RADIOLOGICAL PROCEDURE is limited to one or a few
                views, the possibility of error in estimating the ABSORBED DOSE to the skin can be higher.
                However, even under worst case conditions, errors should be less than a factor of two. Of
                course, most of this error can be eliminated by assessing the position of the PATIENT and
                calculating the appropriate correction factor.
            </p>
            <p>
                The document has the flexibility of allowing an alternative to the use of the defined PATIENT
                ENTRANCE REFERENCE POINT for systems without an ISOCENTRE. In this case, the PATIENT
                ENTRANCE REFERENCE POINT is located at a position, defined by the MANUFACTURER to be
                representative of the point of intersection of the REFERENCE AXIS with the PATIENT SURFACE, and
                stated in the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS. Examples of situations where the MANUFACTURER
                would use this alternative method of defining the PATIENT ENTRANCE REFERENCE POINT, would be
                X-RAY EQUIPMENT that senses the actual FOCAL-SPOT-TO-SKIN DISTANCE, deviates from traditional
                geometry or has a FIXED FOCAL SPOT TO SKIN DISTANCE.

                X-RAY EQUIPMENT can be equipped with means for manually or automatically configuring
                the operating parameters for different INTENDED USES. In addition, different operating parameter
                sets can be required to comply with differing national regulations and preferences. In
                accordance with 203.5.2.4.5.101 b), details of MODES OF OPERATION and certain other available
                settings are required to be stated. In accordance with 203.5.2.4.5.101 c), the associated values
                of REFERENCE AIR KERMA (RATE) are required to be given, together with the configurations and
                test geometries by which they can be verified by the method described in this subclause.
                The first stage of compliance testing is to check this information (other than the dosimetric values)
                for compliance with the requirements and compatibility with the measuring method. If the
                information complies, it is used in the measuring PROCEDURE to verify the compliance of the
                stated values of REFERENCE AIR KERMA (RATE). Otherwise, the ME EQUIPMENT is considered noncompliant
                without further testing. Thus, the ME EQUIPMENT is delivered with a set of verified
                values and also with sufficient information to enable the values to be re-checked at any time. It
                is emphasised that, in any circumstances, the test method to be applied is intended to be only
                in respect of conditions that are within the range of the INTENDED USE.

                Subclause 203.6.2.1 e) – Normal initiation and termination of the IRRADIATION
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of RADIOSCOPY is to observe objects or structures in real time [16], [17]. A LAST
                IMAGE HOLD RADIOGRAM is, in essence, a RADIOGRAPH intended for review for study, consultation,
                or education instead of continuing RADIOSCOPY [16], [17].
            </p>
            <p>
                The intent is to limit the number of RADIOGRAPHY images to those necessary for diagnosis or to
                document findings and device placement. Typical RADIOGRAPHY dose rates are at least 10 times
                greater than those for RADIOSCOPY [16]. If a LAST IMAGE HOLD RADIOGRAM demonstrates the
                finding adequately, it can be studied instead of performing RADIOGRAPHY. When no additional
                RADIOGRAPHY images are obtained, PATIENT RADIATION dose is reduced [16].
            </p>
            <p>
                At present, RADIOSCOPY equipment is designed so that the RADIOSCOPY IRRADIATION terminates
                after the release of continuous pressure by the OPERATOR, regardless of the quality of the
                resultant LAST IMAGE HOLD RADIOGRAM. For radioscopic IRRADIATIONS longer than 1 s or so, this
                is of no consequence, as the image quality of the resultant LAST IMAGE HOLD RADIOGRAM will be
                adequate. However, if the RADIOSCOPY IRRADIATION is too short, the LAST IMAGE HOLD RADIOGRAM
                will not be usable, because image quality will not be adequate. Sufficient time is necessary to
                stabilize the AUTOMATIC INTENSITY CONTROL before terminating the radioscopic IRRADIATION.
            </p>
            <p>
                The new requirement permits automatic creation of a LAST IMAGE HOLD RADIOGRAM of adequate
                quality with a short tap on the RADIOSCOPY pedal and automatic termination of the radioscopic
                IRRADIATION, rather than manual termination. This avoids an IRRADIATION which is too short and
                results in an inadequate LAST IMAGE HOLD RADIOGRAM, or an IRRADIATION that is longer than
                necessary to obtain a LAST IMAGE HOLD RADIOGRAM of adequate quality. It permits a LAST IMAGE
                HOLD RADIOGRAM to be obtained with the shortest possible RADIOSCOPY IRRADIATION that will
                result in a usable image, and therefore with the lowest possible PATIENT RADIATION dose. It is
                understood that under certain circumstances (e.g. very low pulse rates) the time limits specified
                in 203.6.2.1 could result in a suboptimal LAST IMAGE HOLD RADIOGRAM.

                High-level control (HLC) or high dose rate mode(s) can be applicable in cases

                At the system level, the X-RAY EQUIPMENT includes one or more IMAGE DISPLAY DEVICES. The

                X-RAY EQUIPMENT can contain one or more PRE-PROGRAMMED EXAMINATION PROTOCOLS (PPEP)
                Each PPEP usually contains settings controlling RADIATION production, X-RAY IMAGE
                RECEPTOR performance, and image processing for presentation. Incorrect or inappropriate
                settings can result in inappropriate IRRADIATION of the PATIENT and/or in inappropriate
                clinical utility of the resulting images.
            </p>
            <p>
                Validating the contents of each PPEP is essential for both safety and performance. For this
                reason, documentation of PPEPs over the life of the EQUIPMENT is useful for the RESPONSIBLE
                ORGANIZATION. Routine audits by the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION are often performed after
                EQUIPMENT installation, commissioning, updates, and clinical configuration changes. Additional
                audits are indicated if there are unexpected changes in RADIATION use or the clinical
                acceptability of the resultant images.
            </p>
            <p>
                Copies of the downloaded PPEP sets might be retained by the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION to
                document their status over the life of the EQUIPMENT.
            </p>
            <p>
                Audits are facilitated by comparing currently installed PPEPs against a reference set of PPEPs
                and flagging the differences. Sources of reference PPEPs include MANUFACTURER'S factory
                defaults or regional settings, as well as local settings for substantially similar EQUIPMENT as

            <p>
                There is a growing demand worldwide for assessing quantitatively the RADIATION exposure of
                PATIENTS during diagnostic and interventional radiology PROCEDUREs. Such demands can also
                be found in regional and national regulations. Some particular standards linked to the second
                edition of IEC 60601-1:2005, IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD2:2020
                include such requirements. The first edition of IEC 60601-2-43 (2000) asks for presentation of
                RADIATION data, introduces terms such as skin dose levels and interventional reference point,
                and requires dosimetry calibration (6.8.2 of IEC 60601-2-43:2000) and dosimetric indications
                (51.102.4 of IEC 60601-2-43:2000). IEC 60601-2-44:2001 and IEC 60601-2-44:2001/AMD1:2002
                require dose statements (29.1.102.1 of IEC 60601-2-44:2001 and IEC 60601-2-44:2001/AMD1:2002)
                and dose information (29.1.103 of IEC 60601-2-44:2001 and IEC 60601-2-44:2001/AMD1:2002).
                The reason that these two standards were first in the introduction of such requirements is that
                both interventional PROCEDUREs and CT examinations are high dose PROCEDUREs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The transition from the second to the third edition of IEC 60601-1:2005,
                IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD2:2020 presents a good opportunity
                to introduce requirements on RADIATION data and dosimetric indication into the particular
                standards for all medical X-ray modalities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The introduction of the first edition of IEC 60601-1-3 (1994) states the following: “In respect of
                economic factors, it is recognized that certain relatively inexpensive types of X-RAY EQUIPMENT
                are sometimes justifiably preferred on grounds of cost. For these, this collateral standard avoids
                imposing requirements that would unduly restrict their medical effectiveness or would add
                disproportionately to the cost.” Based on this principle, this document exempts DIRECT
                RADIOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT from the requirements to provide dosimetric indications in 203.6.4.5.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, for X-RAY EQUIPMENT specified for DIRECT RADIOGRAPHY (including film-screen
                RADIOGRAPHY), a simplified dosimetric indication could be used by displaying a value, i.e. “the
                REFERENCE AIR KERMA resulting from the last radiographic IRRADIATION shall be displayed in mGy
                together with this unit”. This value might be pre-programmed as a function of the LOADING
                FACTORS. It also implies that when shifting from screen-film RADIOGRAPHY to CR, it is the
                responsibility of the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION to ensure compliance with the general
                requirement for INDIRECT RADIOGRAPHY, or else compliance of the actual X-ray system with this
                document can no longer be stated. INDIRECT RADIOGRAPHY includes CR and DR systems as well
                as any kind of RADIOGRAPHY performed with image intensifiers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The accuracy requirement for dosimetric indications of ± 35 % was harmonized with EU and
                US requirements and is consistent with the real technically achievable level of accuracy. For
                RADIATION data stated in the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS, the accuracy requirement of ± 50 %
                has been set to reflect the method used for compliance assessment and the fact that the
                RADIATION output of a given type of X-RAY TUBE can vary within broad limits.
            </p>
            <p>
                It shall be stressed that all requirements on RADIATION data and dosimetric indication in
                the IEC standards are meant to give information to the OPERATOR about PATIENT doses and not
                to PATIENTS themselves.

                examinations, limits of STRAY RADIATION in the SIGNIFICANT ZONES OF OCCUPANCY are required.
                The instructions for use shall state the applicable limits and declare that they are not exceeded.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where they apply, these requirements can provide a normalized basis for the local rules and
                guidelines that have to shall be established for the protection of persons, taking into account
                the local circumstances and the prevailing WORKLOAD.

        <ol class="num-counter">
            <li>
                The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a worldwide organization for standardization
                comprising all national electrotechnical committees (IEC National Committees). The object of IEC is to
                promote international co-operation on all questions concerning standardization in the electrical and
                electronic fields. To this end and in addition to other activities, IEC publishes International
                Standards, Technical Specifications, Technical Reports, Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) and
                Guides (hereafter referred to as “IEC Publication(s)”). Their preparation is entrusted to technical
                committees; any IEC National Committee interested in the subject dealt with may participate in this
                preparatory work. International, governmental and non-governmental organizations liaising with the IEC
                also participate in this preparation. IEC collaborates closely with the International Organization for
                Standardization (ISO) in accordance with conditions determined by agreement between the two
                organizations.
            </li>

            <li>
                The formal decisions or agreements of IEC on technical matters express, as nearly as possible, an
                international consensus of opinion on the relevant subjects since each technical committee has
                representation from all interested IEC National Committees.
            </li>

            <li>
                IEC Publications have the form of recommendations for international use and are accepted by IEC National
                Committees in that sense. While all reasonable efforts are made to ensure that the technical content of
                IEC Publications is accurate, IEC cannot be held responsible for the way in which they are used or for
                any misinterpretation by any end user.
            </li>

            <li>
                In order to promote international uniformity, IEC National Committees undertake to apply IEC
                Publications transparently to the maximum extent possible in their national and regional publications.
                Any divergence between any IEC Publication and the corresponding national or regional publication shall
                be clearly indicated in the latter.
            </li>

            <li>
                IEC itself does not provide any attestation of conformity. Independent certification bodies provide
                conformity assessment services and, in some areas, access to IEC marks of conformity. IEC is not
                responsible for any services carried out by independent certification bodies.
            </li>

            <li>
                All users should ensure that they have the latest edition of this publication.
            </li>

            <li>
                No liability shall attach to IEC or its directors, employees, servants or agents including individual
                experts and members of its technical committees and IEC National Committees for any personal injury,
                property damage or other damage of any nature whatsoever, whether direct or indirect, or for costs
                (including legal fees) and expenses arising out of the publication, use of, or reliance upon, this IEC
                Publication or any other IEC Publications.
            </li>

            <li>
                Attention is drawn to the Normative references cited in this publication. Use of the referenced
                publications is indispensable for the correct application of this publication.
            </li>

            <li>
                Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this IEC Publication may be the
                subject of patent rights. IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent
                rights.

            <p>This document has been prepared to provide, based on IEC 60601-1:2005 (third edition) and
                its collaterals, a complete set of safety requirements for ME EQUIPMENT for RADIOGRAPHY and
                RADIOSCOPY. The purpose of this second edition is to introduce changes to reference the second
                amendment (2020) to IEC 60601-1:2005 and associated collateral standards. Moreover, in
                Annex AA a clarification of the term for ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE is provided. This document
                addresses the system level of X-RAY EQUIPMENT, which consists of a combination of an X-RAY
                GENERATOR, ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT and ACCESSORIES. Component functions are addressed as
                far as necessary.
            </p>

            <p>The minimum safety requirements specified in this document are considered to provide for a
                practical degree of safety in the operation of ME EQUIPMENT for RADIOGRAPHY and RADIOSCOPY.
                Requirements for additional provisions for ME EQUIPMENT for interventional applications are
                covered by IEC 60601-2-43.

                Compliance is checked by examination of the design documentation. In Figure 203.101, w1

                    The boundary of an X-RAY FIELD is described by the locus of points at which the AIR KERMA RATE

                    BEAM AXIS coincides with the REFERENCE AXIS, it is assumed that the plane of interest is
                    orthogonal to the REFERENCE AXIS; also that the major axes intersect on the REFERENCE AXIS and

            <p>
                IEC 60601-1:2005, IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD:2020 state that the term ESSENTIAL
                PERFORMANCE is directly related to the performance of a clinical function (definition 3.27 in IEC
                60601-1:2005 and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012). Table 201.101 of this document provides a list of
                requirements that can be correlated with the performance of a clinical function and that can therefore
                be ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE. The decision on whether any of these requirements constitutes ESSENTIAL
                PERFORMANCE is subject to a RISK EVALUATION that considers the INTENDED USE of the X-RAY EQUIPMENT. The
                identification of potential ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE requirements is justified because the RISK associated
                with ionizing X-RADIATION is overweighed by the benefits expected from the examination. The intent of
                the requirements in this document is to support MANUFACTURERS in providing state-of-the-art X-RAY
                EQUIPMENT that is safe under NORMAL CONDITIONS. Requirements under SINGLE FAULT CONDITIONS are either
                stipulated in clauses of IEC 60601-1:2005, IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD2:2020 and
                this document or are determined by the RISK EVALUATION. There can be cases in which simply detection of
                single faults during regular checks within a maintenance or a QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURE is considered
                sufficient. In some other cases, a RISK which occurs under SINGLE FAULT CONDITIONS is considered
                acceptable due to its low probability or low SEVERITY. However, SINGLE FAULT CONDITIONS that result in
                an unacceptable RISK due to the probability of harm or the SEVERITY of harm require additional RISK
                CONTROL measures. These RISK CONTROL measures are selected according to ISO 14971 and can include
                frequent functional self-monitoring, installation of redundant parts, or appropriate protective
                measures.

                ISOCENTRE, a point on the REFERENCE AXIS 15 cm from the ISOCENTRE towards the FOCAL SPOT has been
                specified as the PATIENT ENTRANCE REFERENCE POINT. This distance is assumed to represent a good
                approximation of the value of the actual FOCAL SPOT TO SKIN DISTANCE during RADIOLOGICAL PROCEDURES. If
                one considers currently available methods to estimate ABSORBED DOSES to selected tissues for RADIOSCOPIC
                and cine angiographic examinations of the coronary arteries of adults [4], [5], these methods rely on
                the use of distinct operating conditions commonly used in RADIOLOGICAL examinations of the heart. These
                operating conditions are associated with a view, an arterial projection, and technique factors on the
                X-RAY EQUIPMENT such as the X-RAY TUBE VOLTAGE (kV), the HALF-VALUE LAYER (HVL), the FOCAL SPOT TO SKIN
                DISTANCE, the FOCAL SPOT TO IMAGE RECEPTOR DISTANCE and the ENTRANCE FIELD SIZE. A review of the
                operating conditions derived from analyses of practice [6], [9] indicates that the defined PATIENT
                ENTRANCE REFERENCE POINT is, in fact, a fair approximation of the FOCAL SPOT TO SKIN DISTANCE for each
                field. The error in estimating the ABSORBED DOSE to the skin introduced from the defined PATIENT
                ENTRANCE REFERENCE POINT should average out as long as the interventional PROCEDURE is composed of
                multiple views. When the RADIOLOGICAL PROCEDURE is limited to one or a few views, the possibility of
                error in estimating the ABSORBED DOSE to the skin can be higher. However, even under worst case
                conditions, errors should be less than a factor of two. Of course, most of this error can be eliminated
                by assessing the position of the PATIENT and calculating the appropriate correction factor. The document
                has the flexibility of allowing an alternative to the use of the defined PATIENT ENTRANCE REFERENCE
                POINT for systems without an ISOCENTRE. In this case, the PATIENT ENTRANCE REFERENCE POINT is located at
                a position, defined by the MANUFACTURER to be representative of the point of intersection of the
                REFERENCE AXIS with the PATIENT SURFACE, and stated in the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS. Examples of
                situations where the MANUFACTURER would use this alternative method of defining the PATIENT ENTRANCE
                REFERENCE POINT, would be X-RAY EQUIPMENT that senses the actual FOCAL-SPOT-TO-SKIN DISTANCE, deviates
                from traditional geometry or has a FIXED FOCAL SPOT TO SKIN DISTANCE.

            <p>
                X-RAY EQUIPMENT can be equipped with means for manually or automatically configuring the operating
                parameters for different INTENDED USES. In addition, different operating parameter sets can be required
                to comply with differing national regulations and preferences. In accordance with 203.5.2.4.5.101 b),
                details of MODES OF OPERATION and certain other available settings are required to be stated. In
                accordance with 203.5.2.4.5.101 c), the associated values of REFERENCE AIR KERMA (RATE) are required to
                be given, together with the configurations and test geometries by which they can be verified by the
                method described in this subclause. The first stage of compliance testing is to check this information
                (other than the dosimetric values) for compliance with the requirements and compatibility with the
                measuring method. If the information complies, it is used in the measuring PROCEDURE to verify the
                compliance of the stated values of REFERENCE AIR KERMA (RATE). Otherwise, the ME EQUIPMENT is considered
                non-compliant without further testing. Thus, the ME EQUIPMENT is delivered with a set of verified values
                and also with sufficient information to enable the values to be re-checked at any time. It is emphasised
                that, in any circumstances, the test method to be applied is intended to be only in respect of
                conditions that are within the range of the INTENDED USE.

            <p class="font-bold">Subclause 203.6.2.1 e) – Normal initiation and termination of the IRRADIATION</p>
            <p>The purpose of RADIOSCOPY is to observe objects or structures in real time [16], [17]. A LAST IMAGE HOLD
                RADIOGRAM is, in essence, a RADIOGRAPH intended for review for study, consultation, or education instead
                of continuing RADIOSCOPY [16], [17].</p>
            <p>The intent is to limit the number of RADIOGRAPHY images to those necessary for diagnosis or to document
                findings and device placement. Typical RADIOGRAPHY dose rates are at least 10 times greater than those
                for RADIOSCOPY [16]. If a LAST IMAGE HOLD RADIOGRAM demonstrates the finding adequately, it can be
                studied instead of performing RADIOGRAPHY. When no additional RADIOGRAPHY images are obtained, PATIENT
                RADIATION dose is reduced [16].</p>
            <p>At present, RADIOSCOPY equipment is designed so that the RADIOSCOPY IRRADIATION terminates after the
                release of continuous pressure by the OPERATOR, regardless of the quality of the resultant LAST IMAGE
                HOLD RADIOGRAM. For radioscopic IRRADIATIONS longer than 1 s or so, this is of no consequence, as the
                image quality of the resultant LAST IMAGE HOLD RADIOGRAM will be adequate. However, if the RADIOSCOPY
                IRRADIATION is too short, the LAST IMAGE HOLD RADIOGRAM will not be usable, because image quality will
                not be adequate. Sufficient time is necessary to stabilize the AUTOMATIC INTENSITY CONTROL before
                terminating the radioscopic IRRADIATION.
                The new requirement permits automatic creation of a LAST IMAGE HOLD RADIOGRAM of adequate quality with a
                short tap on the RADIOSCOPY pedal and automatic termination of the radioscopic IRRADIATION, rather than
                manual termination. This avoids an IRRADIATION which is too short and results in an inadequate LAST
                IMAGE HOLD RADIOGRAM, or an IRRADIATION that is longer than necessary to obtain a LAST IMAGE HOLD
                RADIOGRAM of adequate quality. It permits a LAST IMAGE HOLD RADIOGRAM to be obtained with the shortest
                possible RADIOSCOPY IRRADIATION that will result in a usable image, and therefore with the lowest
                possible PATIENT RADIATION dose.
                It is understood that under certain circumstances (e.g. very low pulse rates) the time limits specified
                in 203.6.2.1 could result in a suboptimal LAST IMAGE HOLD RADIOGRAM.</p>

            <p>High-level control (HLC) or high dose rate mode(s) can be applicable in cases of extreme body sizes of
                the PATIENT or when there is a need for extraordinarily high image quality for a certain PROCEDURE with
                a certain PATIENT. In such cases the higher PATIENT exposure can be justified if the benefit of the
                PROCEDURE cannot be attained with lower dose rates. Local regulations can set different limits on the

            <p>At the system level, the X-RAY EQUIPMENT includes one or more IMAGE DISPLAY DEVICES. The imaging
                performance characteristics of IMAGE DISPLAY SYSTEMS are provided by other standards (e.g. IEC 62563-1
                [18] and DICOM, Part 14 [19]). The IMAGE DISPLAY SYSTEM settings selected under 203.6.4.3.106 are
                meaningful provided that the IMAGE DISPLAY DEVICE conforms to the X-RAY EQUIPMENT's specifications and
                the IMAGE DISPLAY DEVICE performs in accordance to its own standards.</p>
            <p>A new addition is to provide a means (e.g. a comparison tool) to flag differences between two (or more)
                PRE-PROGRAMMED EXAMINATION PROTOCOLS. The comparison tool can be used to compare EXAMINATION PROTOCOLS
                for different examinations or different versions of the same protocol.</p>
            <p>X-RAY EQUIPMENT can contain one or more PRE-PROGRAMMED EXAMINATION PROTOCOLS (PPEP). Each PPEP usually
                contains settings controlling RADIATION production, X-RAY IMAGE RECEPTOR performance, and image
                processing for presentation. Incorrect or inappropriate settings can result in inappropriate IRRADIATION
                of the PATIENT and/or in inappropriate clinical utility of the resulting images.</p>
            <p>Validating the contents of each PPEP is essential for both safety and performance. For this reason,
                documentation of PPEPs over the life of the EQUIPMENT is useful for the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION.
                Routine audits by the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION are often performed after EQUIPMENT installation,
                commissioning, updates, and clinical configuration changes. Additional audits are indicated if there are
                unexpected changes in RADIATION use or the clinical acceptability of the resultant images.</p>
            <p>Copies of the downloaded PPEP sets might be retained by the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION to document their
                status over the life of the EQUIPMENT.</p>
            <p>Audits are facilitated by comparing currently installed PPEPs against a reference set of PPEPs and
                flagging the differences. Sources of reference PPEPs include MANUFACTURER'S factory defaults or regional
                settings, as well as local settings for substantially similar EQUIPMENT as defined by the RESPONSIBLE
                ORGANIZATION.</p>
            <p>This document does not require any specific content or format of a PPEP. It implies that all controls and
                settings within a PPEP that affect either RADIATION production or the characteristics of the resulting
                images be appropriately documented in a form that facilitates comparisons between versions.</p>

            <p class="font-bold">Subclause 203.6.4.5 – Dosimetric indications</p>
            <p>There is a growing demand worldwide for assessing quantitatively the RADIATION exposure of PATIENTS
                during diagnostic and interventional radiology PROCEDUREs. Such demands can also be found in regional
                and national regulations. Some particular standards linked to the second edition of IEC 60601-1:2005,
                IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 and IEC 60601 1:2005/AMD2:2020 include such requirements. The first edition
                of IEC 60601-2-43 (2000) asks for presentation of RADIATION data, introduces terms such as skin dose
                levels and interventional reference point, and requires dosimetry calibration (6.8.2 of IEC
                60601-2-43:2000) and dosimetric indications (51.102.4 of IEC 60601-2-43:2000).
                IEC 60601-2-44:2001 and IEC 60601-2-44:2001/AMD1:2002 require dose statements (29.1.102.1 of IEC 60601-2
                44:2001 and IEC 60601-2-44:2001/AMD1:2002) and dose information (29.1.103 of IEC 60601 2-44:2001 and IEC
                60601-2-44:2001/AMD1:2002). The reason that these two standards were first in the introduction of such
                requirements is that both interventional PROCEDUREs and CT examinations are high dose PROCEDUREs.</p>
            <p>The transition from the second to the third edition of IEC 60601-1:2005, IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 and
                IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD2:2020 presents a good opportunity to introduce requirements on RADIATION data and
                dosimetric indication into the particular standards for all medical X-ray modalities.</p>
            <p>The introduction of the first edition of IEC 60601-1-3 (1994) states the following: “In respect of
                economic factors, it is recognized that certain relatively inexpensive types of X-RAY EQUIPMENT are
                sometimes justifiably preferred on grounds of cost. For these, this collateral standard avoids imposing
                requirements that would unduly restrict their medical effectiveness or would add disproportionately to
                the cost.”
                Based on this principle, this document exempts DIRECT RADIOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT from the requirements to
                provide dosimetric indications in 203.6.4.5. However, for X-RAY EQUIPMENT specified for DIRECT
                RADIOGRAPHY (including film-screen RADIOGRAPHY), a simplified dosimetric indication could be used by
                displaying a value, i.e. “the REFERENCE AIR KERMA resulting from the last radiographic IRRADIATION shall
                be displayed in mGy together with this unit”. This value might be pre-programmed as a function of the
                LOADING FACTORS.
                It also implies that when shifting from screen-film RADIOGRAPHY to CR, it is the responsibility of the
                RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION to ensure compliance with the general requirement for INDIRECT RADIOGRAPHY, or
                else compliance of the actual X-ray system with this document can no longer be stated. INDIRECT
                RADIOGRAPHY includes CR and DR systems as well as any kind of RADIOGRAPHY performed with image
                intensifiers.</p>
            <p>The accuracy requirement for dosimetric indications of ± 35 % was harmonized with EU and US requirements
                and is consistent with the real technically achievable level of accuracy. For RADIATION data stated in
                the ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS, the accuracy requirement of ± 50 % has been set to reflect the method used
                for compliance assessment and the fact that the RADIATION output of a given type of X-RAY TUBE can vary
                within broad limits.</p>
            <p>It shall be stressed that all requirements on RADIATION data and dosimetric indication in the IEC
                standards are meant to give information to the OPERATOR about PATIENT doses and not to PATIENTS
                themselves.</p>

            <p class="font-bold">Subclause 203.13.4.101 – SIGNIFICANT ZONES OF OCCUPANCY with limited STRAY RADIATION
            </p>
            <p>In RADIOLOGICAL examinations which require the OPERATOR or staff to be close to the PATIENT during
                LOADING, a significant contribution to the total STRAY RADIATION exposure to these persons is often made
                by SCATTERED RADIATION from the PATIENT and other objects in the X-RAY BEAM. For X-RAY EQUIPMENT
                conventionally and most frequently used for performing gastro-intestinal examinations, limits of STRAY
                RADIATION in the SIGNIFICANT ZONES OF OCCUPANCY are required.
                The instructions for use shall state the applicable limits and declare that they are not exceeded. Where
                they apply, these requirements can provide a normalized basis for the local rules and guidelines that
                shall be established for the protection of persons, taking into account the local circumstances and the
                prevailing WORKLOAD.</p>
