                The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a worldwide organization for standardization
                comprising all national electrotechnical committees (IEC National Committees). The object of IEC is to
                promote international co-operation on all questions concerning standardization in the electrical and
                electronic fields. To this end and in addition to other activities, IEC publishes International
                Standards, Technical Specifications, Technical Reports, Publicly Available Specifications (PAS) and
                Guides (hereafter referred to as “IEC Publication(s)”). Their preparation is entrusted to technical
                committees; any IEC National Committee interested in the subject dealt with may participate in this
                preparatory work. International, governmental and non-governmental organizations liaising with the IEC
                also participate in this preparation. IEC collaborates closely with the International Organization for
                Standardization (ISO) in accordance with conditions determined by agreement between the two
                organizations.

            This document has been prepared to provide, based on IEC 60601-1:2005 (third edition) and
            its collaterals, a complete set of safety requirements for ME EQUIPMENT for RADIOGRAPHY and
            RADIOSCOPY. The purpose of this second edition is to introduce changes to reference the second
            amendment (2020) to IEC 60601-1:2005 and associated collateral standards. Moreover, in
            Annex AA a clarification of the term for ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE is provided. This document addresses the
            system level of X-RAY EQUIPMENT, which consists of
            a combination of an X-RAY GENERATOR, ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT and ACCESSORIES. Component
            functions are addressed as far as necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
            The minimum safety requirements specified in this document are considered to provide for a
            practical degree of safety in the operation of ME EQUIPMENT for RADIOGRAPHY and RADIOSCOPY.
            Requirements for additional provisions for ME EQUIPMENT for interventional applications are
            covered by IEC 60601-2-43.
